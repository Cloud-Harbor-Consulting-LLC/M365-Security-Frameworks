# Contributing to M365-Security-Frameworks

Thank you for considering a contribution. This repo is maintained as a practical reference for the Microsoft 365 security community, and external perspectives make every framework stronger.

## Ways to contribute

- **Report an issue** — bugs in scripts, inaccuracies in design docs, or gaps in a framework
- **Suggest an enhancement** — a new policy to add to a baseline, a new framework to propose, or a clearer business-case angle
- **Submit a pull request** — fixes, improvements, or new content

## Before you start

1. **Open an issue first for any non-trivial change.** It saves everyone time if we align on scope before code is written.
2. **One logical change per pull request.** Mixing unrelated changes makes review harder.
3. **Match the existing style.** Naming conventions (e.g., `CA-COV001-AllUsers-BlockLegacyAuth` for Conditional Access policies) are intentional — read the framework's README before renaming artifacts.

## Pull request flow

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Test any scripts in a lab tenant — **never submit code you haven't run**
4. Open a pull request with a clear title and a description covering:
   - What the change does
   - Why it's needed
   - How you validated it (lab tenant, test output, sign-in log screenshot, etc.)
5. Be responsive to review feedback — most PRs need at least one round of iteration

## Style guide

- **Markdown** — use GitHub-flavored Markdown; keep line length reasonable
- **PowerShell** — follow [PSScriptAnalyzer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer) defaults; include `-WhatIf` or `-ReportOnly` support on any deployment script
- **JSON policy templates** — format with 2-space indentation; strip tenant-specific IDs before committing
- **Business-case docs** — write for a non-technical executive audience; assume the reader is a CFO, CIO, or board member

## Reporting security issues

Do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities in scripts or templates. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and focused on the work. Contributions are evaluated on merit — not on affiliation or seniority.

## Questions

Open a GitHub issue tagged `question`, or reach out via the maintainer contact in the root [README](./README.md#about).
